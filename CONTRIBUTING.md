# Contributing to Loggregator
The Loggregator team uses GitHub and accepts contributions via
[pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

We ask that you follow these general guidelines to help us accept your PR as
quickly as possible:

1. Create an issue before you start work on your PR.
  - We may have advice to give you or requests for your final solution.
2. Include at least one test in your PR.
  - For bugs, it's also useful to provide a failing test in your issue.
3. Run the unit tests: `go test -race ./...`
4. Run [LATs](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/logging-acceptance-tests-release) in a
   [standalone loggregator](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator-release#standalone-loggregator)
   deployment on `bosh-lite`.

## Contributor License Agreement

Follow these steps to make a contribution to any of our open source repositories:

1. Ensure that you have completed our CLA Agreement for
    [individuals][individual-cla], or [corporations][corp-cla].
1. Set your name and email (these should match the information on your
   submitted CLA):

1. Set your name and email (these should match the information on your submitted CLA)
  ```
  git config --global user.name "Firstname Lastname"
  git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
  ```

1. All contributions must be sent using GitHub pull requests as they create a
   nice audit trail and structured approach.

The originating github user has to either have a github id on-file with the
list of approved users that have signed the CLA or they can be a public
"member" of a GitHub organization for a group that has signed the corporate
CLA.  This enables the corporations to manage their users themselves instead
of having to tell us when someone joins/leaves an organization. By removing a
user from an organization's GitHub account, their new contributions are no
longer approved because they are no longer covered under a CLA.

If a contribution is deemed to be covered by an existing CLA, then it is
analyzed for engineering quality and product fit before merging it.

If a contribution is not covered by the CLA, then the automated CLA system
notifies the submitter politely that we cannot identify their CLA and ask them
to sign either an individual or corporate CLA. This happens automatially as a
comment on pull requests.

When the project receives a new CLA, it is recorded in the project records,
the CLA is added to the database for the automated system uses, then we
manually make the Pull Request as having a CLA on-file.
